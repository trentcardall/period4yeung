Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results | Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions | Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements | Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem | . Dice Game . Do these two algorithms give the same results? . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) else: if diceRoll &gt;= 2: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) else: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) if diceRoll &gt;= 2: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) if diceRoll &lt; 2: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . In what instances do the algorithms yield different results for the same input? | Why does this happen? | . Can we adjust the second algorithm to yield the same results? . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) if diceRoll &gt;= 2 and diceRoll &lt; 4: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) if diceRoll &lt; 2: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . What can be taken away from this? . Small changes/mistakes can have a big impact on the result | There is often more than one way to achieve the same result | . Conditional vs Boolean . How could this conditional scenario be replaced with a boolean scenario? | . IF (isHoliday) { school⟵false } ELSE { IF(isWeekday) { school⟵true } ELSE { school⟵false } } . What needs to be true and what needs to be false in order for you to go to school? . First conditional: If isHoliday is true, you do not need to go to school | Second conditional: If isWeekday is true, you do need to go to school. However, if it is false, school also becomes false | . Therefore, in pseudo code, this statement could be written as: . school⟵((NOT (isHoliday)) AND (isWeekday)) | Keep in mind that both of these statements yield the same results, and neither of them are incorrect | . gonna add another part .",
